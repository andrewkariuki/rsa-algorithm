# RSA Program

The program is able to:

- Provide a range and randomly select two prime numbers.
- Compute the value for n=p*q.
- Determine the Totient = (p-1) (q-1).
- Output the possible encrypting keys.
- Randomly select(e).
- Determine the key for decrypting (d).
- Output public  (e,n) and private key pairs ( ( d,n).
- Encrypt a message using public key pairs( e,n).
- Decrypt the cipher using the private key pairs ( d,n).

## Run the program

```python main.py```

You will need to set the brounderies for your range by:

==*Enter upper range:*==
==*Enter lower range:*==

After running the algorithm, you will have the opportunity to enter a message to enrypt.

==*What would you like encrypted or decrypted?(Separate numbers with ',' for decryption.*==

You will also have the ability to choose between encryption and decryption.

==*Type '1' for encryption and '2' for decrytion.*==
